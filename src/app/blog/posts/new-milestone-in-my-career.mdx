Every career is a journey, filled with challenges, growth, and those significant moments that mark a shift in our path. Today, I’m excited to share the beginning of mine.

## The Unexpected Catalyst

I spent years in university studying biochemistry, peering through microscopes and running experiments. While I enjoyed the analytical nature of my studies, something was missing. It took a casual conversation with my cousin to shake up my career trajectory. They showed me that coding wasn't the impenetrable fortress I'd imagined – it was a craft that anyone with dedication could learn. This simple revelation changed everything.


## Embracing the Learning Curve

Joining Moringa School's coding bootcamp was like diving into the deep end – exhilarating and terrifying all at once. The learning curve was steep, but something magical happened during those intense weeks of learning. Each solved problem, each working piece of code, triggered a satisfaction I'd never experienced before. It was as if my brain had discovered a new form of expression, a new way to solve puzzles that had always been there, waiting to be unlocked.

## Five Years Later: The Best Decision I Never Planned

Looking back over these five years in tech, I can't help but smile at how a single conversation led to such a profound career shift. The transition from biochemistry to coding might seem dramatic, but both fields share core elements: problem-solving, attention to detail, and the need to understand complex systems. The main difference? In coding, I found my true calling. Every day brings new challenges, new technologies to master, and new problems to solve. It's not just a job – it's a passion that keeps growing stronger.
